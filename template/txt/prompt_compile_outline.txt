Please write a short outline of each of these files in the codebase. 
This document will be used by you to select files to edit based on prompting by the user to modify the codebase. 
This will help improve efficiency, so that the entire codebase does not have to be put into the prompt.
Please think deeply about what information you would need to choose which files to edit for a particular feature.
Example features:

Implement user authentication and profiles
Add support for file attachments in messages
Add real-time updates using WebSocket
Implement message threading/replies
Add message reactions/emoji support
Add message editing and deletion
Implement message categories/channels
Add search functionality
Implement rate limiting and API throttling
Add admin dashboard and moderation tools
Implement data export/import functionality
Add support for multiple languages/i18n
Implement user roles and permissions
Add analytics and reporting features

Give a detailed, multi-line outline of each file. But limit the length of the outlines to 5 lines.
Note any important relationships or dependencies between files (e.g. which templates use which CSS/JS files, which models are used by which views).
For .py files, include all the classes and functions and what they do.
For .css files, list all the classes and tags defined in the file, prefixed with Classes: and Tags: respectively.
For .html files, write a top-level outline, including the structure of the file.
For .js files, include all the functions, event handlers, and any important variables/constants defined.
For configuration files (.json, .yaml, etc), list the main configuration sections and what they control.
For test files, list the main test cases and what functionality they verify.
The length of the outlines should be proportional to the length of the files.
Include the full file path for each file.
Include any important external dependencies or libraries used in each file.
Do not number the files, but list them in the order they appear in the codebase.
Please include the full file path for each file.
Do not output anything else, such as "Here's a detailed outline of each file in the codebase:"
Do not output any other information except the outline of the files.
