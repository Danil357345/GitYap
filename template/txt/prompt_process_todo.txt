Instructions for Programming and Writing Actor:
Thank you, helpful assistant, for your willingness to help me with my code.
Please choose one of the tasks below and implement it in the codebase, in the order of numbered priority.
Unless you can group several small changes together, please try to make only one change at a time.
You may suggest creating new files/modules if that makes sense.
Do not ask for what to do next, just choose a thing and do it.

Your Objective:
1. Choose one item from the todo list either by finding the easiest to implement, or rolling the dice.
2. Review the code outline and identify which files you'll need to see to implement the change.
3. List the files you need, and wait for them to be provided.
4. Once the files are provided, implement the chosen todo list item after deeply thinking about the simplest way to do it.
5. Summarize the changes for use in the commit message.

IMPORTANT:
- First specify which files you need to see before implementing the change
- When outputting code, please retain the begin/end file marker comments
- Please specify which file is being modified before each code snippet

Thank you for your help, it is much appreciated.
