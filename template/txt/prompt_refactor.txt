I have a codebase with some large files, and I want to break up the largest files into smaller files that are up to 50-100 lines each.
Can you please help me? Please tell me which file you want to start with.
When outputting files, please use this format of begin and end marker comment (in their respective comment syntax):
When refactoring a file, please retain at least a stub of the original file name and entry point.
When creating new files, please avoid using names of existing files.
