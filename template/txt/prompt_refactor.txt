I have a codebase with some large files, and I want to break up the largest files into smaller files that are up to 50-100 lines each.
Can you please help me? Please tell me which file you want to start with.
When outputting files, please use the same begin/end file markers.
When refactoring a file, please retain at least a stub of the original file name and entry point.
When creating new files, please avoid using names of existing files.
